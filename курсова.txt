The world ocean is the water surface of the Earth that washes all continents and islands.

Pacific Ocean

The Pacific Ocean is the oldest ocean on our planet.
A large part of it is located in the hot thermal zone.
 The largest number of islands is concentrated in the Pacific Ocean.
The equator divides it almost in the middle, and 180 meridians pass through its water area.
 The maximum depth of the Pacific Ocean is 11,022 m (Mariana Trench).

 Arctic Ocean

 The Arctic Ocean is the coldest of all oceans because it is located in the cold belt.
  On the subpolar territory, the sun's rays fall obliquely and heat the water surface a little.
   The water temperature in this ocean is about -2Â°C throughout the year. Throughout the year, the Arctic Ocean is covered with ice.

 A thick ice cover up to 5 m thick does not have time to completely melt during the short and cold summer.

 Only in summer does a wide strip of water free of ice form along the coasts of continents.
